# Password-Generator
This is a password generator that uses HTML CSS and Javascript. On clicking the generate password button the user will be given a prompt instructing them to provide a desired password length between 8-128 characters, then decide if they would like to include : Uppercase characters, lowercase characters, special characters and/or number characters. If the user does not select any field they will be presented with an alert that instructs the user to please select at least one field then returns the function.

In future I would like to find a way to have styled prompt boxes that are more visually appealing to the User.
